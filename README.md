How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
The best way to ensure my program is fully functional is with thorough and comprehensive testing. By performing a good testing of our code
we can avoid releasing bugs with our software that could cost a lot of money to our company as well as many issues to the users. We can ensure our code is secure by 
following the best secure coding practices such as cryptography, input validation, etc.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
To interpret the user needs, it is important to listen to/read the requirements very carefully to undertand what is the goal of the user and ask questions as needed
to ensure everybody is on the right page.

How do I approach designing software?
My approach to designing software at the moment, consists of a few steps: First, reading the requirements multiple times. Second, outlining a vague idea of the gameplan.
And third, creating a flowchart with a more structured plan to follow through.
